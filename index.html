                            First player to have an empty hand wins!
                            <br><br>
                            You have to match either by the number, color, or the symbol/Action. For instance, if the card in play is a red card that is an 8 you have to place either a red card or a card with an 8 on it. You can also play a Wild card (which can alter current color in play).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After playing a wild please select the new color you would like in play
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Reverse – If going clockwise, switch to counterclockwise or vice versa. It can only be played on a card that matches by color, or on another Reverse card. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Skip – When a player places this card, the next player has to skip their turn. It can only be played on a card that matches by color, or on another Skip card. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Draw Two – When a person places this card, the next player will have to pick up two cards and forfeit his/her turn. It can only be played on a card that matches by color, or on another Draw Two. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Wild – This card represents all four colors, and can be placed on any card. The player has to state which color it will represent for the next player. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Wild Draw Four – This acts just like the wild card except that the next player also has to draw four cards as well as forfeit his/her turn.
