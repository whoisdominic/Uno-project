-----Uno Project game logic-----

Check if there is any comparison to be made 

First we check for color 

If the colors match or it is wild

Play it


next we check for number

If The numbers match

Play it 

If the type is equal to action card && the colors match 

Play it + run the card effect function






TO DO:

Player class --- Done
Card Classes --- Done
get Factory working --- Done
get game start function working that distributes cards!! --- Done
End turn capability --- Done
win conditions --- Done
action cards effect functions --- Done

*Game cards comparison logic(90%) --- has bug at two action cards. If a blue skip is down
then it will still allow a red draw two. Bug is due to the 'action' type being the same

break point is at type/action 250
-- Possible fixes--
adding an additional if statement inside type/action or modifying the logic in the ()


*wild color choice -- Possible ways to do it

1. promt the user to choose a new color
2. use a switch statement to append a new card with just the color 


-_-_- DONE -_-_-


*Rules alert

UI/Design

*BONUS* 
*card regeneration and reshuffle when deck array is empty

Multiple players
Player Hand Privacy
Rules smooth popout
