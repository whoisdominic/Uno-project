-----Uno Project game logic-----

Check if there is any comparison to be made 

First we check for color 

If the colors match or it is wild

Play it


next we check for number

If The numbers match

Play it 

If the type is equal to action card && the colors match 

Play it + run the card effect function






TO DO:

Player class --- Done
Card Classes --- Done
get Factory working --- Done
get game start function working that distributes cards!! --- Done



Game cards comparison logic(90%) --- has bug at two action cards. If a blue skip is down
then it will still allow a red draw two. Bug is due to the 'action' type being the same
-- Possible fixes--
adding an additional if statement inside type/action or modifying the logic in the ()







action cards effect functions

End turn capability

win conditions

card regeneration and reshuffle when deck array is empty

UI/Design
